# Medical Charges Analysis
## Analyzing the drivers of medical charges.


Health insurance and medical bills are integral aspects of our everyday lives, with medical charges being influenced by various factors such as age, gender, lifestyle, and pre-existing health conditions. Understanding these factors is crucial for optimizing healthcare costs and improving policy decisions.

This study leverages an intriguing dataset from an insurance company, which includes medical charges for individuals with diverse backgrounds. The dataset consists of seven variables: Medical Charges, Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Number of Children, Gender, Smoking Status, and Region.

The goal of this comprehensive analysis is to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies within the data to gain a deeper understanding of the factors associated with medical charges. This involves a multi-step approach:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To visualize data distributions, identify potential correlations, and detect outliers.

2. Correlation Analysis: To assess the strength and direction of relationships between medical charges and the other variables.

3. Segmentation and Statistical Analysis: To examine differences in medical charges across various demographic and lifestyle segments.

4. Classification Analysis: To predict the groupings of medical charges and identify important features using classification models.

5. Regression Analysis: To predict actual medical charges and quantify the impact of each significant feature.

By employing these methods, we aim to provide valuable insights into the factors driving medical charges, which can inform healthcare providers and policymakers in their efforts to enhance resource allocation, patient care strategies, and cost management.
